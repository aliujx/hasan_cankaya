      <td>Swedish massage is one of the most commonly offered massage techniques. It’s sometimes called a classic massage. The technique aims to promote relaxation by releasing muscle tension.

        Swedish massage is gentler than deep tissue massage and better suited for people interested in relaxation and tension relief.

      <td>Deep Tissue Massage</td>
      <td>60 min / 90 min</td>
      <td>Deep tissue massage is a massage technique that’s mainly used to treat musculoskeletal issues, such as strains and sports injuries. 
        It involves applying sustained pressure using slow, deep strokes to target the inner layers of your muscles and connective tissues. This helps to break up scar tissue that forms following an injury and reduce tension in muscle and tissue.</td>
